here I want a github->network

now cp some files form tata

nothing show up on the frame, and I see this 

	QPainter::begin: Widget painting can only begin as a result of a paintEvent
	QPainter::setPen: Painter not active

OK, now every time the window resized, the cout here will be called once more.
but the painting in resized event won't be done. The reason it just like above:

QPainter::begin: Widget painting can only begin as a result of a paintEvent
