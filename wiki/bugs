gitbro-patch README 

gives three empty patchs, and only the last patch is not empty.
this happens to all file that are remamed or moved to another dir 

But

	git log -p --follow  README

still works, and the output is actully nice. easy to handle.

Fix: so why not just use  "git log -p --follow  README"
