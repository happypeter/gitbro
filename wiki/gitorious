for the sake of backup

	peter@cow:~/git-reader/wiki$ git remote add gitorious git@gitorious.org:git-reader/git-reader.git
	peter@cow:~/git-reader/wiki$ git branch -r
	  gitorious/master
	  origin/HEAD
	  origin/master
now I run 

	git push gitorious

to push my stuff to gitorious sever as a backup of the github repo

## website branch

I need to explicitly do:

	git push gitorious website

to push stuff, other wise this branch is ignored, quite cumbersome.
but this is natural, if you do not push website explicitly. It is just considered your local test branch,
and thus ingnored as it should be.

and after the push, I see at http://gitorious.org/gitbro/gitbro
	
	* Branches: master

turns into 

	* Branches: master website

after a page refresh. That means there is no setup for creating a remote branch.
all you need is to create it locally, and push it.
