for the sake of backup

	peter@cow:~/git-reader/wiki$ git remote add gitorious git@gitorious.org:git-reader/git-reader.git
	peter@cow:~/git-reader/wiki$ git branch -r
	  gitorious/master
	  origin/HEAD
	  origin/master
now I run 

	git push gitorious

to push my stuff to gitorious sever as a backup of the github repo

## website branch

I need to explicitly do:

	git push gitorious website

to push stuff, other wise this branch is ignored, quite cumbersome.
but this is natural, if you do not push website explicitly. It is just considered your local test branch,
and thus ingnored as it should be.
