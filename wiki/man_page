	root@cow:~# cp /usr/share/man/man1/printf.1.gz /usr/share/man/man1/peter.1.gz
	root@cow:~# man peter

it works, and if I want my own manual, all I need to do is to cp the
manpage of another program, open it in emacs, edit the stuff and do
not touch the tags, ah...stupidly easy.

How to convert manpage, that is nroff, into html?

peter@cow:~$ man2html  peter.1.gz>Desktop/p.html
