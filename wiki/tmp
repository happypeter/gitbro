I find switch to the branch to get or write down some docs really annoying, 
So in the future, I won't use that branch in day-to-day work, rather I will have
a dir named wiki here, and have all the daily doc here.

and it is good to have the doc and good in one brach, at least for me. since what I add in the
doc is usually closely related with the code changed in the same commit

I will use markdown as the format, since I do not want to invoke muse mode every time, it is simple too slow
using markdown format, you don't need to use any mode to assist you, since it is so easy.

    hi 
    this is a indentation block
