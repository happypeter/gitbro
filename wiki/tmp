[git]
today I stupidly did a 

	git reset --hard last_commit

and lost all my modification, I think there is a way back, but I do not know how

but the right way to revert a stupid commit is this:

	git reset --mixed last_commit
	# do your modifiacation, may be delete some junk you addicdently
	# commited
	git commit -a -C ORIG_HEAD
	#then you get all the info in last commit you did.

Now I want add some buttons and lineEdit, since .ui files are slower
to load, so I won't use designer to do the layout.
[gitorious]
git push git@gitorious.org:git-reader/git-reader.git

[regexp]
http://www.regular-expressions.info/reference.html
	\+ matches +
but it ends with a error unknown escape sequence \+
I want to know how to match '+'

[gitk]
gitk is not so ugly, today I changed its font, and it looks nice
now. the problem is gitk try to display everything in one frame, make
things kind of messy.
github display is still more joyable to look at

I want all the diffs show up in popup windows. it will look quit confortable.
[highlighting]
http://doc.trolltech.com/qq/qq21-syntaxhighlighter.html
Adding syntax highlighting to a QTextEdit involves subclassing
QSyntaxHighlighter, reimplementing the highlightBlock() function, and
instantiating the QSyntaxHighlighter subclass with the QTextEdit's
underlying QTextDocument (returned by QTextEdit::document()) as the
parent.
