## doc
I may use doxygen or Qdoc for documentation in the  future
## qgit is really inspiring:
[qgit](http://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=139897&ssid=33933)
qgit has one file tracing functions, and a lot more
examples

## [coding style](http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/pages/QtCodingStyle)

1.	indent with 4 spaces
2.	

Now I want add some buttons and lineEdit, since .ui files are slower
to load, so I won't use designer to do the layout.
[gitorious]
git push git@gitorious.org:git-reader/git-reader.git

## [regexp](http://www.regular-expressions.info/reference.html)
	\+ matches +
but it ends with a error unknown escape sequence \+
I want to know how to match '+'

[gitk]
gitk is not so ugly, today I changed its font, and it looks nice
now. the problem is gitk try to display everything in one frame, make
things kind of messy.
github display is still more joyable to look at

I want all the diffs show up in popup windows. it will look quit confortable.
##[highlighting](http://doc.trolltech.com/qq/qq21-syntaxhighlighter.html)

Adding syntax highlighting to a QTextEdit involves subclassing
QSyntaxHighlighter, reimplementing the highlightBlock() function, and
instantiating the QSyntaxHighlighter subclass with the QTextEdit's
underlying QTextDocument (returned by QTextEdit::document()) as the
parent.
