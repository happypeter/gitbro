since the `serach.py` can only do exact match now, that means:

if I see a class named `QStringList` in a .cpp file
I need to manually change `QStringList` into `qstringlist` before I can use it as a key word to search.
this is obviously unaccatable. 

the solution is to use Regex with the command `grep`

you need to use `` to embrace the regex to use it, e.g

	peter@cow:~/te$ grep '\<qt\>' * 

will match "qt" as a separated word in all the files in the current dir

I think my serach issue can be solved by `ignore case`:

	peter@cow:~/te$ man grep|grep ignore -n
	52:       -i, --ignore-case
	peter@cow:~/te$ grep -i '\<qt\>' *
	qt:qt
	qt:Qt
	qt:QT
	peter@cow:~/te$
