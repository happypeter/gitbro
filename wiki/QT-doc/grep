since the `serach.py` can only do exact match now, that means:

if I see a class named `QStringList` in a .cpp file
I need to manually change `QStringList` into `qstringlist` before I can use it as a key word to search.
this is obviously unaccatable. 

the solution is to use Regex with the command `grep`
