## strange!
today I add a file named git.cpp, however `git status` can not track it.
it takes me quite a bit time to realize it is because I wrote my `.gitignore` stupidly
## protocals
git support several protocals:
ssh, http(s), git, rsync, ...
but only ssh support push, you will fail if you try to push through others.

## git reset --hard HEAD 

I just did some really big and stupid modification to some files(these files need to be in index already), then I diecide to go back and throw away all the modification.
	
	git reset --hard HEAD

works fine. but if you have new file that are not in index, you can not remove it by doing this.

today I stupidly did a

        git reset --hard last_commit

and lost all my modification, I think there is a way back, but I do not know how

but the right way to revert a stupid commit is this:

        git reset --mixed last_commit
        # do your modifiacation, may be delete some junk you addicdently
        # commited
        git commit -a -C ORIG_HEAD
        #then you get all the info in last commit you did.

## merge git-reader into gitbro is possiable

git can actully merge two branches, even they share no same files and history
(thus no conflicts)
so there are two things I can do:

1.	merge gitbro:website in to master(git merge website)
2.	merge git-reader:master into gitbro:master(do a fetch and merge, or just a pull)

I may not do this but it is really happy to know it can be done.
and maybe I will merge kdocs into edocs someday.
