[git]
today I stupidly did a

        git reset --hard last_commit

and lost all my modification, I think there is a way back, but I do not know how

but the right way to revert a stupid commit is this:

        git reset --mixed last_commit
        # do your modifiacation, may be delete some junk you addicdently
        # commited
        git commit -a -C ORIG_HEAD
        #then you get all the info in last commit you did.

## merge into gitbro is possiable

git can actully merge two branches, when the share no differently files
(thus no conflicts, )
so there are two things I can do:

1.	merge gitbro:website in to master(git merge website)
2.	merge git-reader:master into gitbro:master(do a fetch and merge, or just a pull)

I may not do this but it is really happy to know it can be done.
