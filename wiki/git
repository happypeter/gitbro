[git]
today I stupidly did a

        git reset --hard last_commit

and lost all my modification, I think there is a way back, but I do not know how

but the right way to revert a stupid commit is this:

        git reset --mixed last_commit
        # do your modifiacation, may be delete some junk you addicdently
        # commited
        git commit -a -C ORIG_HEAD
        #then you get all the info in last commit you did.
