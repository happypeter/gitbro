I want to have
engine.py   gitbro-patch
in one file, and name this file gitbro-onefile, it just generate all
the  patches for a single file, just as what gitbro-patch already can
do.  

finally, there will be only one exe file, that must be gitbro, so all
functions shall be spicified by passing corresponding argument to
gitbro to invoke.

And I want a argument --moin to get moinmoin meta data style
data.

If possible, I think I will port code into plain bash script.

When this is mature, I can use this to generate a repository with more
than one file(randomly selected by user who think these files are
related in some way)
--
Big idea,

When I think about how to display the output of gitbro, I first want a
simply html brower for the job. 

But when I open Qt creator, I start to realize this is really
wonderful thing to have(it has a embedded browser as well)
