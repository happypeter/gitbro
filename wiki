I want to have
engine.py   gitbro-patch
in one file, and name this file gitbro-onefile, it just generate all
the  patches for a single file, just as what gitbro-patch already can
do.  

And I want a argument --moin to get moinmoin meta data style
data.

If possible, I think I will port code into plain bash script.

When this is mature, I can use this to generate a repository with more
than one file(randomly selected by user who think these files are
related in some way)
