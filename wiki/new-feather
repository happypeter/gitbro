this is my current work flow to develop a new feature

	git branch -b feather-x
	git checkout feather-x

and now I will do many changes on branch `feather-x`, I may do 10 commits, 
out of which, 7 are quit ugly and only 3 really clear and logical. 

But I want all the commits, since I may want rewind at any point, but eventally
when I checkout my master branch, and try to merge, how can I get rid of the 7
dirty commits?

	git cherry-pick <commit>

is what I need
