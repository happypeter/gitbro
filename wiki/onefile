Now I just want to oldest version of the file out

do 
	git log -p --follow filename

then one the buttom of the out put, you see

	--- /dev/null
	+++ b/wiki/onefile

then the patch below this block of text is obviously the first version of the file

but if you do not like it in a patch format, you can get it with `git check <commit>`
