#PROBLEM:

I find checking qt class reference doc is very cumbersome for me now, 
every time I go to www.google.com and type `4.6 qwidget` and wait for a long time
till the page shows up. Bad, bad!!!

BTW. I do not like the way qtcreator does this.

#SOLUTION:

so first I download all the pages

	wget -r http://doc.trolltech.com/4.6/

## TUI is perfered
done by "qref"
