#PROBLEM:

I find checking qt class reference doc is very cumbersome for me now, 
every time I go to www.google.com and type `4.6 qwidget` and wait for a long time
till the page shows up. Bad, bad!!!

and I do not like the way qtcreator doing this.

#SOLUTION:

so first I download all the pages

	wget -r http://doc.trolltech.com/4.6/

it takes ages to finish though.

now one possiable way to do it is to install it in my local www_root
and write a google-like(simplely) search engine for pages lookup.
just the way I do happypeter.users.sf.net

## TUI is perfered

but thinking of my gitk->tig switch no long before. I think maybe I can do my work 
more efficiently with lynx rather than firefox, if there are not so many pngs in the 
Qt docs(this seems to be no so many pics luckily)

### so I can 

1.	put all pages in /home/peter/qt-doc
2.	write a bash to invoke lynx to open the page I want.

But since I am not familiar with lynx, so I would try the firefox way first
## install in www_root

first we need a cig script `search.py` 

	root@cow:/usr/lib/cgi-bin# ls
	search.py
	root@cow:/usr/lib/cgi-bin# chmod +x search.py 

and we need a 'index.html` in `/var/www/`

## the TUI way is done by "qref.sh"
