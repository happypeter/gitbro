I think my daytoday doc can grow this way:

1.	first we have one file named wiki
2.	when we have too many topics in wiki, we make it a dir
3.	and divide some big topics in to echo own file
4.	when the same happens to one of these files, we make it a dir as well
5.	just keep going this way, my doc actually grow like a tree.

so we can 

1.	use markdown format, because muse is too complex, and we must have a format
2.	so we have folders and subfolders, we will generate them into index pages
3.	anyway just let things grow organically.
