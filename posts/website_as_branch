 I am trying to port this website as a branch of my project Gitbro
 I want this:

    Gitbro:website

But I forgot how I did these several months ago, so I went to gitcasts.com to see the podcast named 
*git-empty-branch* again. 

##  the podcast way 
the command that Scott used was: 

    git-symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/website

but my test looks like this(on my ubuntu 10.04 ):

    Releas-:ptop:~/gitbro$ git-symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/website
    git-symbolic-ref: command not found

this worked, but did not turn out to be expected:

    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/website
    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ git branch
      master 

Note: the above git branch output is strange, there is no "*" preceeding the branch
I think that's why I get this error:

    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ git checkout -b website
    fatal: You are on a branch yet to be born
    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ ls .git/refs/heads/
    master

all the following works correctly:

    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ git rm --cached -r .
    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ rm -rf *
    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ git commit --allow-empty "init commit empty branch"

So, I am done with the branch Creation.
