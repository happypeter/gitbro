ISSUE: now I have a repo *website-gitbro/*, I want to port it into my project Gitbro's main repo
as a branch named *website*


##  Creat a empty branch--the podcast way 
I went to gitcasts.com to see the podcast named 
*git-empty-branch* again. 

the command that Scott used was: 

    git-symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/website

but my test looks like this(on my ubuntu 10.04 ):

    Releas-:ptop:~/gitbro$ git-symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/website
    git-symbolic-ref: command not found

this worked, but did not turn out to be expected:

    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/website
    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ git branch
      master 

Note: the above git branch output is strange, there is no "*" preceeding the branch
I think that's why I get this error:

    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ git checkout -b website
    fatal: You are on a branch yet to be born
    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ ls .git/refs/heads/
    master

all the following works correctly:

    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ git rm --cached -r .
    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ rm -rf * ## rm .gitignore manually here if you have one
    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ git commit --allow-empty -m "init commit empty branch"

So, I am done with the branch Creation.

## merge *website-gitbro* in

first I did was:

    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ git checkout website 
    Switched to branch 'website'
    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ git remote add web ../website-gitbro/
    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ git pull web master

things are done, but not nicely, since we now had a merge commit, obviously we need a rebase.
but it seems I can not do a rebase since the two branch has no common Ancestor, can you?

## push to the remote

    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ git push origin website 
    To git@github.com:happypeter/gitbro.git
     ! [rejected]        website -> website (non-fast-forward)

the story was that I did this several month ago, so that means I created a
remote *website* branch, later I found I did not like it, So I deleted it. Now
I see, it is obvious that I only did it locally, this is proved by doing this:

    git clone git@github.com:happypeter/gitbro.git --branch website

and I successfully clone the gitbro, and it has only one branch:

    peter@peter-laptop:~/xxx/ttt/gitbro$ git branch
    * website
    peter@peter-laptop:~/xxx/ttt/gitbro$ 

but I hated all the old stuff, how can I delete it on remote site?

Now the only way I know is to delete the whole git repo on the server, and
push the local repo(without the branch *website*) to the server

this is simplely done by git push =git push= =origin website=
