ISSUE: now I have a repo *website-gitbro/*, I want to port it into my project Gitbro's main repo
as a branch named *website*


##  Creat a empty branch--the podcast way 
I went to gitcasts.com to see the podcast named 
*git-empty-branch* again. 

the command that Scott used was: 

    git-symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/website

but my test looks like this(on my ubuntu 10.04 ):

    Releas-:ptop:~/gitbro$ git-symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/website
    git-symbolic-ref: command not found

this worked, but did not turn out to be expected:

    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/website
    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ git branch
      master 

Note: the above git branch output is strange, there is no "*" preceeding the branch
I think that's why I get this error:

    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ git checkout -b website
    fatal: You are on a branch yet to be born
    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ ls .git/refs/heads/
    master

all the following works correctly:

    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ git rm --cached -r .
    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ rm -rf *
    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ git commit --allow-empty "init commit empty branch"

So, I am done with the branch Creation.

## merge *website-gitbro* in

first I did was:

    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ git checkout website 
    Switched to branch 'website'
    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ git remote add web ../website-gitbro/
    peter@peter-laptop:~/gitbro$ git pull web master

things are done, but not nicely, since we now had a merge commit, obviously we need a rebase.
but it seems I can not do a rebase since the two branch has no common Ancestor, can you?
