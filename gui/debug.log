Billie, 
   I think next time when you want to talk about source code related
   stuff, you can write your Email here inside the source tree, then
   we will know what version of source we are talking about when we
   look back in the future.

   and when things are no longer needed, like a comment then dated, or
   a bug that alreay fixed, you can just deleted all the related info,
   if you want to check them in the future, we can use gitbro to
   generate report out of the githistory.

   so My suggestion is: do not use mailing list any more, write
   anything in side the repo, and delete it whenever it is no longer
   needed. 

Regards
Peter

    Now, I add a new text widget with a vertical scrollbar and fix a few bugs last time, for example,
    1. the GUI can display full screen

yes, I tested, and verified this.

    2. use pack geometry management instead of grid.  Maybe grid method is better than pack, but I can
     not operate it well to make GUI full-screen display.
    3. a little trick with entry widget, when click 'search' button, then the entry widget will appear in the
     right side of the 'search' button. It is also stupid, if click 'search' again, the entry will appear again.
     So, I need to fix the bug. Though this feature is not necessary, but I think it is interesting so I do not
     want to cancel it. But those are all decorations now.

See my attached patch, I think it fixed this bug.

    4. the file button can work now. If click it, a file named '11.txt' in the current directory will be displayed
     in the right side text widget. This also can be rewritten to be more general. It is just a test in order to
     know how to read a file in  text widget.

nice progress.

    5. There is no necessary to add a horizontal scrollbar in text widget, because a option wrap with default
     value WORD forbids the functionality of the horizontal scrollbar, with the default value a line can be split
     by word when it reach the boundary of the text widget. Only configure wrap with NONE, the horizontal scrollbar
     will take effect.

good hacking, this is useful, thx.

P.S:
I've added you as a  collaborator of our github:gitbro repository. This means you can clone the repo, and commit the current source code into
the our upstream repo when you feel like. Plz commit the source and add as many comments as you can,  maybe in the future you think part of the comments are out of date, you can simply delete them. we have git, all your write now will be in git history even they are deleted one day, but whenever we want to go back and check where we were started form, the comments will surely be of some help.
