Billie, 
   I think next time when you want to talk about source code related
   stuff, you can write your Email here inside the source tree, then
   we will know what version of source we are talking about when we
   look back in the future.

   and when things are no longer needed, like a comment then dated, or
   a bug that alreay fixed, you can just deleted all the related info,
   if you want to check them in the future, we can use gitbro to
   generate report out of the githistory.

   so My suggestion is: do not use mailing list any more, write
   anything in side the repo, and delete it whenever it is no longer
   needed. 

Regards
Peter
