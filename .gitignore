# when I am done with some test in my repo
# there willa always be some junk files left in my repo
# that's why I need this .gitignore file to record these
# file avoiding commit them by accident 
# However this make it hard to find them, since they are no longer visual to
# "git st". If I want to find them, use
#       
#       git clean -x -n
#
# "-n" means dry run, since I do need some of the file listed here
# like my *tags* file and cscope file
